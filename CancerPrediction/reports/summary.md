The project processes medical data on cervical cancer risk, applies machine learning models, and interprets results using SHAP. It imports libraries for data processing (pandas, numpy), visualization (matplotlib, seaborn), machine learning (XGBoost, CatBoost, SVM), data balancing (SMOTE), and feature analysis (SHAP). It loads the dataset, replaces missing values, drops columns with over 50% missing data, converts the target variable ("Biopsy") to binary, and ensures numeric formatting. It applies log transformation and winsorization to reduce skewness. It balances the dataset using SMOTE. The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%). Several machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, XGBoost, CatBoost) are trained and evaluated using accuracy and F1-score. SHAP is used to interpret feature importance and visualize how each feature affects predictions. The project produces various plots to show data distributions, model performance, and feature impact.The Streamlit interface allows users to upload datasets, preprocess data, train models, and visualize results through interactive plots and feature importance explanations.
